               I come a place colloquially refered to as "the armpit of California", a beautiful, warm and comfy place near Sacramento 
               where the sun occasionally touches the Earth in the summer and transforms the place into a scorching hell.
             
               I went to "the bay" for my college education where I got my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2017.
               
               <figure>

               </br>In undergraduate, I had experience interning in a sustainability non-profit where I negotiated with local 
               businesses to decrease their food packaging waste by offering discounts for people with reusable containers. 
             
               We also conducted campus trash audits to quantify what types of trash was ending up in the landfill and how much recyclable
               trash (aluminum foil, recyclable plastics, glass, cans) was mis-allocated to the landfills.

               This experience gave me a feeling that the path to changing human behavior towards sustainability was hugely marred
               by the lack of affordable alternatives to the wonderful cheap disposable plastics we throw away everyday.
             
               </br>I decided to go into research because I wanted to explore the type of research around sustainability and also 
               investigate microbial processes to mitigate pollution or decompose our waste.
               
               Additionally, I researched indoor air quality and designed a bioelectrical stimulation reactor to investigate 
               the cell metabolisms of Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidizing Organisms (Anammox).
             
               My research in Anammox metabolisms made me realize how I especially loved studying the cell metabolisms and 
               was increasingly interested in methods to model and understand coding better such that I could find a way to quantify
               metabolic changes to microbes. 
               
               </br>My interests in coding and modeling lead me to apply to Daniel J. Jacob's lab, an environmental engineering lab specializing
               in developing the chemistry model to simulate air pollutant emissions and their evolution in the atmosphere.
               
               I am currently a Environmental Engineering PhD student in Harvard University. 
               
               I researched in Daniel J. Jacob's lab, collaborating with NASA to develop and test the GEOS-5 Earth System model. 
               
               I was investigating how vertical resolution can improve the the simulation of transpacific pollution plumes.
               
               While I enjoyed learning and becoming familiar with model code, I still feel a strong desire to return to researching cell 
               metabolisms. 
             
               </br>Though changing from environmental engineering to systems biology is drastic, making the risks 
               necessary to ensure I am in a field I am passionate about is important to me.
               
               I hope to use control theory, statistics and neural networks to elucidate gene expression, protein production and help design 
               novel methods to treat human illnesses.
