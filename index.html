               I come a place colloquially refered to as "the armpit of California", a beautiful, warm and comfy place near Sacramento 
               where the sun occasionally touches the Earth in the summer and transforms the place into a scorching hell.
             
               I originally started as a biology major at UC Davis. 
               
               While I loved biology a lot, I really enjoyed mathematics and engineering applications to biology. 
               
               I switched to chemical engineering because it was a versatile major that would give me the mathematical and modeling 
               basis to apply to biology. 
               
               I transferred to UC Berkeley and got my bachelors in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2017.

               </figure> 
               
               </br>In undergraduate, I had experience interning in a sustainability non-profit where I negotiated with local 
               businesses to decrease their food packaging waste by offering discounts for people with reusable containers. 
             
               We also conducted campus trash audits to quantify what types of trash was ending up in the landfill and how much recyclable
               trash (aluminum foil, recyclable plastics, glass, cans) was mis-allocated to the landfills.

               </figure>  
             
               This experience gave me a feeling that the path to changing human behavior towards sustainability was hugely marred
               by the lack of affordable alternatives to the wonderful cheap disposable plastics we throw away everyday.
             
               </br>I decided to go into research because I wanted to explore the type of research around sustainability and also 
               investigate microbial processes to mitigate pollution or decompose our waste.
               
               Additionally, I researched indoor air quality and designed a bioelectrical stimulation reactor to investigate 
               the cell metabolisms of Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidizing Organisms (Anammox).
             
               My research in Anammox metabolisms made me realize how I especially loved studying the cell metabolisms.
    
               The toughest part of the research was determining if negative changes to the reactor were due to the controlled variable
               or the difficulties in maintaining anaerobic conditions in my set-up. 
               
               I was increasingly interested in mathematical methods to model and code such that I could find a way to quantify the 
               response of the microbes to controlled conditions. 
    
               To pursue this my interests in coding, I participated in the UC Berkeley CleanWeb Hackathon with a group of friends. 
    
               In this hackathon, we used javascript to create a user-friendly interface to visualize pipeline leaks, associated 
               chemical toxins and local watersheds that could be affected. 
    
               This hackathon gave me the interests in visualizing data and coding.
               
               My control theory class in UC Berkeley was my most favorite class because it introduced me to the mathematics crucial to understanding dynamics of systems (biological growth, 
               pollutant dispersion, etc) and also the coding tools to modeling them.
               
               </br>My interests in coding, sustainability and modeling lead me to apply to Daniel J. Jacob's lab, an environmental engineering lab specializing
               in developing the chemistry model to simulate air pollutant emissions and their evolution in the atmosphere.
               
               I am currently a Environmental Engineering PhD student in Harvard University. 
               
               I researched in Daniel J. Jacob's lab, collaborating with NASA to develop and test the GEOS-5 Earth System model. 
               
               I was investigating how vertical resolution can improve the the simulation of transpacific pollution plumes.

               Everyone I worked with in my lab was kind and encouraging however I did not feel a fit and wanted to explore
               my previous interests in dynamics and controls. 
               
               </br>I took a graduate data science course in Fall 2018 that involved using machine learning to interpret 
               how changes in controlled variables were related to the response. 

               In this class we investigated machine learning and used Neural Networks in our final project of sorting dogs into
               their breeds based upon an image training set of 20,000 pure-bred dogs. 

               Understanding and working with statistics, probability and machine learning to model complicated relationships 
               between variables reminded me of my interests in modeling the dynamics of biological responses and I became interested
               using those models to work with the complicated relationships of gene expression and signal transduction. 

               While I enjoyed learning and becoming familiar with model code, I still feel a strong desire to return to researching cell 
               metabolisms. 

               </br>I want to apply my modeling background to biological processes while exploring stochastic modeling, statistics and
               neural networks.

               </br>Though changing from environmental engineering to systems biology is drastic, making the risks 
               necessary to ensure I am in a field I am passionate about is important to me.
               
               I hope to use control theory, statistics and neural networks to elucidate gene expression, protein production and help design 
               novel methods to treat human illnesses.

               cooking ideas, methods to survive unbearably cold winters, etc...
