    <div id="transpac-active" class="research-topic"></br><h4>Vertical Resolution Requirements to Simulate Transpacific Ozone Pollution, Graduate Research Topic</h4>
        Observations show that chemical plumes injected to high altitudes (the free troposphere) by
        convection, volcanoes, or stratospheric intrusions can retain their identity as well-defined
        vertical layers for a week or more as they are transported on intercontinental scales. Global
        atmospheric models fail to reproduce these persistent plumes due to rapid numerical diffusion.
        Under realistic shear flow, plumes filament down to the grid scale where any advection scheme
        collapses to first order and rapid numerical dissipation occurs. Eastham and Jacob (2017) found
        that the primary limitation to resolving the plumes was the vertical resolution as General
        circulation models (GCMs) have prioritized increasing horizontal resolution versus vertical
        resolution. The new 132-level (L132) GEOS-5 model has potential to improving transport of transcontinental plumes 
        and better representing intercontinental influences on non-linear surface ozone chemistry. Improvement in transport is
        evaluated via comparisons between inert tracer plumes simulated in L132 and the 72-level
        GEOS-5 model (L72). I focus on transpacific Asian pollution plumes transported to North
        America, for which we have extensive complementary aircraft, satellite, surface measurements
        and ozonesonde data, to evaluate the L132’s quantification of Asian pollution influence on
        western US surface ozone. </br>
        I primarily identified GEOS-5 model bugs, physical inconsistencies and collaborated with NASA scientists to fix and ensure valid model 
        performance and output. To do this, I developed an understanding of the FORTRAN 77 and 90 model framework and in particular
        familiarized myself with the code structure of the chemistry and dynamics module.</br>

             Investigating Extracellular Electron Transpot in Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria, Undergraduate Research Project</h4>
             Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria can anaerobically capture aqueous carbon dioxide and also convert nitrite and 
             ammonia to dinitrogen. 

             Their slow doubling time of 7-22 days, complicated symbiosis with other microbes, and inability to be isolated
             remains are major hurdles for their usage for both carbon capture and energy efficient wastewater treatment. 

             Scientific research in Anammox focuses on optimizing growth situations for their well-being by understanding
             the carbon fixation pathways, their population dynamics, and exchange of materials between members of the Anammox
             consortium.
             
             Researchers have examined the variation of growth and activity of Anammox with different inorganic or organic 
             electron donors. 

             However, the need for the addition of chemical electron donors could be satisfied by supplying
             electrons directly via current. 

             Extracellular electron transfer (EET) through cellular electron carriers, 
             notably c-type cytochrome, is used for transfer of electrons between cells and toward the surrounding environment.
             Specifically, extracellular c-type cytochrome could allow the Anammox cell to utilize the electric current 
             supplied by electrodes in cellular metabolic processes.

             Extracellular electron transport is attributed to extracellular membrane electron carriers such as quinones 
             (notably or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS)), phenazines, flavins (Kotloski & Gralnick, 2013) and heme 
             proteins (notably c-type cytochrome(Rosenbaum, Aulenta, Villano, & Angenent, 2011)). 
            
             Furthermore, these surface electron carriers facilitate the transport of electrons on the surface of the cell to 
             the internal metabolic processes within the cell(Thrash & Coates, 2008). 
                
             The examination of the structure of the Anammox extracellular matrix reveals an abundance of c-type cytochrome. These form the majority of the 
             extracellular complex, manifesting in the vermillion color of the Anammox aggregate(Kartal et al., 2011). 
             
             C-type cytochrome, an electron transport protein in the electron transport chain has been previously 
             demonstrated to be a feasible extracellular electron carrier in geobacter, desulfovibrio, and various other 
             denitrifiers(Thrash & Coates, 2008). 
             
             </br><img src="ashaw3895.github.io/assets/img/anammox process.png" alt="anammox process", class="center"></br>
             
             According to the figure above (de Almeida, Wessels et al. 2016), c-type cytochrome redox is strongly correlated with hydrazine 
             dehydrogenase and hydrazine synthase. 
                
             It may be presumed that the addition of electrons to c-type cytochrome will result in a negative charge 
             accumulation in the Anammoxosome lumen and result in a stronger proton-motive force to generate more ATP.

             Previous studies involving extracellular electron transport via electrodes to biofilm bacteria revealed an 
             increase in population growth and cellular metabolites, which is correlated with discrete current measurements 
             spanning from 10-100mA (Thrash & Coates, 2008).
             
             I applied a series of different currents to an Anammox bioreactor to achieve two purposes: 
             1) To investigate if adding current to Anammox bacteria could increase the metabolic activity and thus the 
             nitrogen removal rate and 2) If it did increase the metabolic rate, what is the optimal current for their growth? </br>

    <div class="research-topic"></br><h4>Biofuels Technology Club, engineer, Spring 2017</h4>
        The goal of the biofuels technology club is to produce biodiesel from cooking oil from the UC Berkeley Dining Commons.
        The ultimate goal would be to to first optimise and develop a laboratory scale process and then begin the process of
        scaling up the project to a pilot plant.
        Each process: the titration removal of free fatty acids, transesterfication, and water washing needed a team of engineers
        who were detail-oriented, were self-driven, and would work well with others. I worked with the water washing to 
        I worked with a team of students on the water washing process: documenting how much water we were using to wash out the
        glycerol and communicating with downstream processes of quality testing to ensure that our biodiesel product met standards.
