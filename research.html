               I developed an algorithm to detect ozone laminae off the coast of Northern California, using data from Trinidad 
               Head, CA ozonesondes. The algorithm was able to filter out high frequency noise, define the free troposphere, 
               recognize high ozone peaks that fit the criteria of free tropospheric ozone laminae. </br>

             Investigating Extracellular Electron Transpot in Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria, Undergraduate Research Project</h2>
             Researchers have examined the variation of growth and activity of Anammox with different inorganic or organic 
             electron donors. However, the need for the addition of chemical electron donors could be satisfied by supplying
             electrons directly via current. Extracellular electron transfer (EET) through cellular electron carriers, 
             notably c-type cytochrome, is used for transfer of electrons between cells and toward the surrounding environment.
             Specifically, extracellular c-type cytochrome could allow the Anammox cell to utilize the electric current 
             supplied by electrodes in cellular metabolic processes. Furthermore, Electrodes supplying a low dose current 
             has been demonstrated to increase the metabolic activity of microbial activity in other anaerobic and aerobic 
             bacteria. I applied a series of different currents to an Anammox bioreactor to achieve two purposes: 
             1) To investigate if adding current to Anammox bacteria could increase the metabolic activity and thus the 
             nitrogen removal rate and 2) If it did increase the metabolic rate, what is the optimal current for their growth?

        We optimized and compared ResNet’s Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks 
        capabilities to predict the breeds of 20,000+ purebred dogs. We used Keras machine learning to implement and test

    <div id="indoorair-active" class="research-topic"></br></br><h2>Indoor Air Quality, Undergraduate Research Project</h2>
        I determined the volumetric flux above various types of lightbulbs to explore the relationship between flow rate and
        power consumption. I designed and built a wood/plastic sheet greenhouse structure to prevent outside influence from 
        introducing artifacts in my data. This work was presented at Spring 2016 UC Berkeley Student Undergraduate Research 
        Forum</br>

    <div id="transpac-active" class="research-topic"></br><h2>Vertical Resolution Requirements to Simulate Transpacific Ozone Pollution, Graduate Research Topic</h2>
        Observations show that chemical plumes injected to high altitudes (the free troposphere) by
        convection, volcanoes, or stratospheric intrusions can retain their identity as well-defined
        vertical layers for a week or more as they are transported on intercontinental scales. Global
        atmospheric models fail to reproduce these persistent plumes due to rapid numerical diffusion.
        Under realistic shear flow, plumes filament down to the grid scale where any advection scheme
        collapses to first order and rapid numerical dissipation occurs. Eastham and Jacob (2017) found
        that the primary limitation to resolving the plumes was the vertical resolution as General
        circulation models (GCMs) have prioritized increasing horizontal resolution versus vertical
        resolution. The new 132-level (L132) GEOS-5 model has potential to improving transport of transcontinental plumes 
        and better representing intercontinental influences on non-linear surface ozone chemistry. Improvement in transport is
        evaluated via comparisons between inert tracer plumes simulated in L132 and the 72-level
        GEOS-5 model (L72). I focus on transpacific Asian pollution plumes transported to North
        America, for which we have extensive complementary aircraft, satellite, surface measurements
        and ozonesonde data, to evaluate the L132’s quantification of Asian pollution influence on
        western US surface ozone. </br>
        I primarily identified GEOS-5 model bugs, physical inconsistencies and collaborated with NASA scientists to fix and ensure valid model 
        performance and output. To do this, I developed an understanding of the FORTRAN 77 and 90 model framework and in particular
        familiarized myself with the code structure of the chemistry and dynamics module.</br>        
        Languages: Python (for analysis), FORTRAN</br>
